% Abstract text - Type abstract here
In recent past smart-phones have become very popular due to their utility in obtaining online services and increasing level of user convenience. The cost of smart-phones is falling and increasing number of laymen are using such devices installed with utility applications. Android operating system runs on nearly 82\% of these smart-phones available today. As in the case of desktop operating systems, mobile operating systems too are prone to viruses and malware and there is a steep increase in malicious Apps on Android's application store from where the users install their applications. There exists techniques and methods that are developed to check whether an application is benign or malicious. Applications are checked before they are uploaded to the applications store. The statistics shows that the existing approaches are falling short. Most of the works classify applications into categories based on certain models. Accuracy of these models has direct impact on the security of the user data these applications have access to on a smart-phone. Sometimes malicious applications are also classified as benign. In such cases, there can be serious security breaches as the application makes its way to users' smart-phones via application store. The main idea of our approach is to restrict the malicious behaviour of applications to provide the security to user's private data and device itself. We have done dynamic and static analysis of applications to know the behaviour of applications. We have build classification models using various machine learning techniques to classify the applications as benign or malicious. If applications are classified as malicious, we have restricted its malicious behaviour without modifying apk file. We have used wrappper around the applications such that applications work normally even after restrictions.
